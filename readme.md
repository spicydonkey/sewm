# SEWM - standard error of a weighted mean

## Method
Follows a formula by Cochran (1977), tested against the bootstrap method by Gatz and Smith (1995).
See discussion on [stackexchange forum](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/25895/computing-standard-error-in-weighted-mean-estimation), especially David Hoffman's comment for the computationally friendly form.
